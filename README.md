## pytorch learning
beginner.py:
- Basic pytorch code to train with random ins/outs

income.py:
- reimplimentation of extra credit question from a.i. homework census data neural net
- currently only about 76% accurate

NeuralNetUtil.py:
- straight copied code from a.i. homework
- used here to build training & testing data for income.py

iteration_param.py:
- shows the stabilizing accuracy with different total number of training iterations
- output stored in data.json

hidden_param.py:
- shows differing accuracy with different hidden layer dimensions
